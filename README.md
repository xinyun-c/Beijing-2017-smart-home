# Beijing-2017-smart-home
This is a project I participated in during the summer of 2017. 
We used java and c++ to control LED lights on sigle chips(the lights represent household appliances),
We also learned Visual Basic and HTML language to write a online website.
The final product will allow us to remote control the light using the webpages we wrote.
